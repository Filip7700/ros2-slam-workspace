# ROS2 SLAM Workspace
This project uses SLAM algorithm for RPLIDAR A3M1, custom xacro files for virtual robot model, and ros2_laser_scan_matcher for odometry. SLAM runs via slam_toolbox on a PC, with ROS2 enabling communication between the PC and RaspberryPi 4 on the my custom made mobile robot, called Csicsko.
